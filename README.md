# Project Altho

### Create a directory for the source files
* You can name this directory however you want, just remember to replace 
* WORKSPACE with your directory for the rest of this guide.
* This can be located anywhere (as long as the fs is case-sensitive)

```bash 
mkdir Altho 
cd Altho
```

### Install Repo in the created directory

>> [Hint: This might take a long time]

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/Project-Altho/manifest -b 13
```

>> [Hint: Want to save some space ? Then use this]

```bash
repo init --depth=1 -u https://github.com/Project-Altho/manifest -b 13
```

### Download the source
```bash 
repo sync --force-sync
```

### Build
```bash
# Set up environment
. build/envsetup.sh
# Choose a target
lunch aosp_$device-userdebug
# Build the code
m start -jX
```
# For Default Pixel Launcher Choose Flag

WITH_PIXEL_LAUNCHER := true
```
